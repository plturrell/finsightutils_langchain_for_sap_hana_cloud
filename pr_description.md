# Comprehensive Improvements to API Design, Security, and Documentation

## Summary

This PR implements a comprehensive set of improvements to address the identified issues with:
1. SQL construction security
2. Error message clarity and user-friendliness
3. API design consistency
4. Security documentation for production deployments
5. Configuration simplification with sensible defaults

## Changes

### 1. Security Improvements

- **Parameterized Queries**: Replaced inline SQL construction with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Security Guide**: Created detailed `/docs/security_guide.md` with comprehensive guidance for:
  - Secure connection parameters
  - Credential management best practices
  - Principle of least privilege implementation
  - Connection pooling for production
  - Container security recommendations
  - Monitoring and auditing

### 2. User Experience Improvements

- **Improved Error Messages**: Completely rewrote error messages to be:
  - More user-friendly and less technical
  - Include context about the problem
  - Provide clear solutions
  - Include examples where helpful
- **Configuration Guide**: Created `/docs/configuration_guide.md` with:
  - Sensible defaults for different scenarios
  - Parameter reference with recommendations
  - Performance optimization tips
  - Error message reference

### 3. API Design Consistency

- **API Design Guidelines**: Created `/docs/api_design_guidelines.md` to establish:
  - Consistent naming conventions
  - Parameter ordering
  - Return type consistency
  - Documentation standards
  - Error handling approaches
- **Updated CONTRIBUTING.md**: Referenced these guidelines for future contributors

### 4. Additional Documentation

- **Advanced Features Guide**: Created `/docs/advanced_features.md` covering:
  - HNSW Vector Indexing
  - Maximal Marginal Relevance
  - Complex metadata filtering
  - Knowledge graph integration
  - Asynchronous operations
  - Connection pooling
- **Updated README.md**: Added references to new documentation and improved examples

## Testing

All changes have been carefully tested to ensure backward compatibility and proper functioning:
- Code changes were minimal and focused on parameterized queries and error message improvements
- No changes to core functionality or APIs
- Documentation updates are comprehensive and accurate

## Related Issues

Addresses the following issues identified in code review:
- Inline SQL construction security concerns
- Lack of comprehensive security documentation
- Inconsistent API design patterns
- Technical and unfriendly error messages
- Complex configuration without clear defaults
