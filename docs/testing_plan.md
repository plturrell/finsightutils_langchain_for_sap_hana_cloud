# Testing Plan for SAP HANA Cloud LangChain Integration with T4 GPU

This document outlines the testing procedure for verifying the successful integration of the frontend (deployed on Vercel) with the T4 GPU backend (hosted on Brev Cloud).

## Prerequisites

- Deployed frontend on Vercel
- Running T4 GPU backend on Brev Cloud (jupyter0-513syzm60.brevlab.com)
- Test credentials for authentication

## Test Credentials

Use the following credentials for testing:

- Admin User: `admin` / `sap-hana-t4-admin`
- Demo User: `demo` / `sap-hana-t4-demo`
- Regular User: `user` / `sap-hana-t4-user`

## Testing Procedure

### 1. Basic Connectivity

- [ ] Verify the frontend loads correctly at the Vercel deployment URL
- [ ] Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verify the health check endpoint returns a success response: `/api/health`

### 2. Authentication

- [ ] Test login with valid admin credentials
- [ ] Test login with valid demo credentials
- [ ] Test login with invalid credentials (should show error message)
- [ ] Verify authentication state is maintained between page reloads
- [ ] Test logout functionality

### 3. Embedding Generation

- [ ] Generate embeddings for a short text with default settings
- [ ] Generate embeddings with different precision modes (INT8, FP16, FP32)
- [ ] Generate embeddings for multiple texts at once
- [ ] Verify processing time and GPU usage indicators

### 4. Similarity Search

- [ ] Perform a basic similarity search with default parameters
- [ ] Test search with filtering by metadata
- [ ] Verify search results contain relevant documents
- [ ] Check similarity scores for correctness

### 5. MMR Search

- [ ] Perform MMR search with default parameters
- [ ] Test MMR search with different lambda values (diversity vs. relevance)
- [ ] Verify results show diverse documents
- [ ] Compare MMR results with regular similarity search results

### 6. Performance Metrics

- [ ] View performance metrics on the deployed system
- [ ] Verify GPU acceleration is being used
- [ ] Check metrics for different precision modes
- [ ] Analyze dynamic batch sizing behavior

### 7. Error Handling

- [ ] Test with invalid inputs to verify error handling
- [ ] Check authentication error handling
- [ ] Verify context-aware error messages
- [ ] Test backend connectivity failure scenarios

### 8. Security Testing

- [ ] Verify CORS protection is working correctly
- [ ] Check for token expiration handling
- [ ] Test API endpoints without authentication
- [ ] Verify JWT token validation

## Expected Results

- All API endpoints should be accessible and functional
- Authentication should work correctly with the provided credentials
- Embedding generation should use the T4 GPU for acceleration
- Similarity and MMR search should return relevant results
- Performance metrics should show GPU utilization
- Error handling should provide clear messages for failures
- Security measures should protect the API endpoints

## Reporting Issues

Document any issues encountered during testing, including:

- Browser/OS environment
- Exact steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots or error messages
- Request/response data if available

## Performance Benchmarks

Record performance metrics for:

- Embedding generation time
- Similarity search latency
- MMR search latency
- Batch processing throughput

Compare results with CPU-only baseline if available.
