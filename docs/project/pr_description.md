# Comprehensive Improvements to API Design, Error Handling, and Documentation

## Summary

This PR implements a comprehensive set of improvements to enhance the overall quality and usability of the SAP HANA Cloud LangChain integration:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implemented context-aware error messages with suggested actions
2. **User-Friendly Frontend**: Added ErrorHandler component with sophisticated error visualization
3. **Improved Documentation**: Added comprehensive inline documentation throughout the codebase
4. **Accurate Similarity Scoring**: Replaced simplified scoring with actual vector similarity measurements
5. **Security Enhancements**: Improved parameterized queries and added security guidelines
6. **Configuration Simplification**: Added sensible defaults and configuration guides

## Key Components

### 1. Error Handling Improvements

- **Context-Aware Backend Errors**: Created `error_utils.py` with:
  - SQL error pattern recognition and interpretation
  - Operation-specific context and suggestions
  - Clear, actionable error messages
  - Consistent error structure

- **Frontend Error Handling**: Added:
  - `ErrorHandler.tsx` component for visualizing errors
  - `ErrorContext.tsx` for global error state management
  - `useErrorHandler.ts` hook for standardized error handling
  - Updated API client with improved error interceptors

### 2. Documentation Enhancements

- **Comprehensive Code Documentation**:
  - Detailed class and method documentation
  - Clear explanation of architectural decisions
  - Usage examples for key components
  - Parameter and return value documentation

- **Additional Guides**:
  - `/docs/security_guide.md` for security best practices
  - `/docs/configuration_guide.md` for configuration options
  - `/docs/api_design_guidelines.md` for API consistency
  - `/docs/advanced_features.md` for advanced usage patterns

### 3. Vector Functionality Improvements

- **Accurate Similarity Scoring**:
  - Replaced simplified scoring with actual vector similarity measurements
  - Added sophisticated fallback for edge cases
  - Improved MMR implementation with proper scoring

- **Enhanced Visualization**:
  - Added caching for reduced vectors
  - Implemented pagination for large vector sets
  - Added advanced clustering algorithm options
  - Real-time filtering capabilities

## Testing

All changes have been thoroughly tested for both functionality and backward compatibility:
- Comprehensive error handling tested with various error scenarios
- Frontend components tested for proper rendering and functionality
- Similarity scoring validated against expected results
- Documentation reviewed for accuracy and completeness

## Enterprise Readiness

This PR significantly improves the enterprise readiness of the codebase:
- Enhanced error handling reduces support overhead
- Comprehensive documentation improves developer onboarding
- Accurate similarity scoring ensures reliable search results
- Security enhancements improve production deployment safety
