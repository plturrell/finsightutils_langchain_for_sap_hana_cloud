# SAP HANA Cloud LangChain Integration Deployment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the streamlined deployment architecture for the SAP HANA Cloud LangChain integration. We have simplified the deployment to focus exclusively on Docker Compose for the NVIDIA GPU-accelerated FastAPI backend and Vercel for the frontend.

## Streamlined Deployment Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Backend**: FastAPI application with NVIDIA GPU acceleration
   - Containerized with Docker using Dockerfile.nvidia
   - Deployed to Kubernetes for scalability and high availability
   - Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs with TensorRT acceleration

2. **Frontend**: React application
   - Deployed on Vercel for global availability and easy updates
   - Configured to connect to the appropriate backend environment

## Deployment Instructions

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sap/langchain-integration-for-sap-hana-cloud.git
cd langchain-integration-for-sap-hana-cloud

# Start the backend with GPU support
docker-compose -f docker-compose.backend.yml up -d

# Start the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Production Deployment

The production deployment is fully automated through the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **For Staging Deployment**:
   - Push changes to the `main` branch
   - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to staging

2. **For Production Deployment**:
   - Create and push a version tag:
     ```bash
     git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
     git push origin v1.0.0
     ```
   - GitHub Actions will build and deploy to production

## Environment Configuration

The deployment uses the following environment configuration:

### Backend Environment Variables

- **Core Configuration**:
  - `GPU_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable GPU acceleration
  - `USE_TENSORRT`: Set to `true` to enable TensorRT optimization
  - `BATCH_SIZE`: Size for embedding batches (larger for production)
  - `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (INFO for staging, WARNING for production)

- **Database Connection**:
  - `DB_HOST`: SAP HANA Cloud host
  - `DB_PORT`: SAP HANA Cloud port
  - `DB_USER`: Database username
  - `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password

- **Security**:
  - `API_KEY`: API authentication key
  - `CORS_ORIGINS`: Allowed CORS origins
  - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret for JWT token generation

### Frontend Environment Variables

- `BACKEND_URL`: URL of the backend API
- `AUTH_ENABLED`: Enable/disable authentication
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Current environment (staging/production)

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Health Endpoints**:
  - `/health`: Basic health check
  - `/health/ready`: Readiness probe
