# Finesse

**The elegant financial model enlightenment tool**

Finesse transforms how you fine-tune financial language models. It's not just a tool—it's an experience that simplifies complexity while delivering exceptional results.

## The Philosophy

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

Finesse embodies three core principles:

1. **Elegance in Simplicity** — Complex processes distilled to their essence
2. **Thoughtful Defaults** — Carefully curated parameters that just work
3. **Meaningful Feedback** — Clear, beautiful information that tells a story

## The Experience

### Prepare

```bash
./finesse prepare
```

Finesse analyzes your financial documents, extracting meaningful relationships and preparing the perfect training data. No complex parameters or technical decisions—just financial understanding, distilled.

### Enlighten

```bash
./finesse enlighten
```

Your model undergoes a transformation, learning the language of finance at a deeper level. Finesse handles all the technical details, showing you meaningful progress as your model evolves.

### Compare

```bash
./finesse compare
```

Witness the transformation. Finesse reveals how your enlightened model now understands financial concepts with greater clarity and precision, showing both metrics and real examples.

### Apply

```bash
./finesse apply --query "What market risks are mentioned in the quarterly report?"
```

Experience the difference. Your enlightened model now responds with deeper financial understanding, capturing nuances that generic models miss.
