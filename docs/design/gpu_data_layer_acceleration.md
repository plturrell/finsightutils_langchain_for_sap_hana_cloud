# GPU Acceleration for SAP HANA Cloud Data Layer

This design document outlines the approach for implementing GPU acceleration directly in the data layer for the SAP HANA Cloud integration with LangChain.

## Overview

Currently, GPU acceleration is primarily implemented at the application layer for embedding generation. This design extends GPU acceleration to the data layer to improve performance for vector operations directly within or close to the database.

## Design Goals

1. Minimize data transfer between SAP HANA and the application
2. Accelerate vector similarity search operations
3. Enable parallel processing of large vector datasets
4. Optimize vector index creation and updates
5. Create a streaming GPU pipeline for vector operations

## Architecture

The GPU-accelerated data layer will consist of several components:
