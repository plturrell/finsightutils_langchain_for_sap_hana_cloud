# Backend Improvements

This document details the improvements made to the backend of the langchain-integration-for-sap-hana-cloud project.

## 1. Health Endpoint Fixes

The health endpoints have been fixed to:
- Use consistent configuration access patterns
- Properly handle missing or unavailable health modules
- Return standardized response formats
- Use environment variables with appropriate fallbacks

## 2. Error Handling Enhancements

Error handling has been improved to:
- Use context-aware error utilities consistently across all API endpoints
- Provide detailed information about errors with suggestions for resolution
- Include metadata about the operation being performed
- Format error messages in a user-friendly way

## 3. GPU Acceleration Optimization

The GPU acceleration components have been optimized to:
- Implement lazy loading for GPU resources when not used
- Reduce memory usage through proper resource management
- Improve hybrid embedding models to not load unused models
- Add proper shutdown and cleanup of GPU resources

## 4. Security Improvements

Security has been enhanced by:
- Implementing proper CORS configuration with environment variable overrides
- Adding warnings when insecure CORS settings are used
- Removing sensitive information from logs
- Implementing proper error handling for security-related issues

## 5. Database Connection Management

Database connections are now managed more effectively:
- Implemented a connection pool with automatic cleanup
- Added connection timeout and health check mechanisms
- Fixed thread safety issues with connection management
- Added proper shutdown handling to close connections

## 6. Version Management

A consistent versioning system has been implemented:
- Created a dedicated version module
- Reading version from VERSION file
- Supporting environment variable overrides
- Including build and commit information
- Providing version information in health endpoints

## 7. Code Organization

The codebase is now better organized:
- Improved module imports
- Better separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Better documentation
- More consistent API design

## How to Test

The improvements can be tested using the provided test script:

```bash
# Run the tests
python -m pytest tests/test_api_fixes.py -v
```

## Configuration Options

New configuration options have been added:
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed origins (default: *)
- `CORS_METHODS`: Comma-separated list of allowed HTTP methods (default: *)
- `CORS_HEADERS`: Comma-separated list of allowed HTTP headers (default: *)
- `CORS_CREDENTIALS`: Allow credentials in CORS requests (default: false)
- `DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS`: Maximum number of database connections (default: 5)
- `DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 600)
