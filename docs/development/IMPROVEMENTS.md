# Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to address the identified issues in the LangChain SAP HANA Cloud integration.

## 0. Vercel 500 Error Fixes

### Diagnostic Tools
- Created a minimal test API (`api/minimal_test.py`) to diagnose function invocation issues
- Enhanced debug proxy (`api/enhanced_debug_proxy.py`) with detailed logging and error reporting
- Created timeout manager (`api/timeout_manager.py`) for configurable API operation timeouts

### Deployment Improvements
- Created specialized deployment scripts for testing and diagnosis
- Added protection bypass support for testing Vercel functions
- Fixed syntax issues in Python code that caused function invocation failures

### Documentation
- Created `docs/troubleshooting_500_errors.md` for general 500 error troubleshooting
- Created `docs/troubleshooting_function_invocation.md` for Vercel-specific function issues
- Added detailed comments to all scripts and API endpoints

## 1. Security Improvements

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Replaced inline SQL construction with parameterized queries
- Improved table creation code to use parameterized approach
