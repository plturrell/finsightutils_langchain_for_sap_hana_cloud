# Monitoring and Alerting Guide for SAP HANA Cloud LangChain Integration

This guide outlines the monitoring and alerting setup for the SAP HANA Cloud LangChain integration with T4 GPU backend.

## Monitoring Components

The system includes several monitoring components:

1. **API Health Monitoring**: Regular health checks of both frontend and backend APIs
2. **GPU Performance Monitoring**: Tracking GPU utilization, memory usage, and temperatures
3. **Database Connection Monitoring**: Checking SAP HANA Cloud connectivity
4. **Request/Response Monitoring**: Tracking API response times and error rates
5. **Authentication Monitoring**: Tracking successful and failed login attempts

## Health Check Endpoints

The system provides several health check endpoints:

- `/api/health`: Basic health check for the API
- `/api/health/system`: System health including CPU, memory, and disk usage
- `/api/health/database`: Database connection status
- `/api/health/gpu`: GPU status and availability
- `/api/health/complete`: Comprehensive health check of all components

## Performance Metrics Endpoint

The system provides a metrics endpoint that returns detailed performance information:

- `/api/metrics`: Returns CPU, GPU, and database performance metrics

## Setting Up Monitoring Tools

### 1. Prometheus Monitoring

The API includes Prometheus metrics exports for key performance indicators:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'sap-hana-langchain'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    metrics_path: '/api/metrics/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['your-vercel-deployment-url.vercel.app']
```

### 2. Grafana Dashboard

A pre-configured Grafana dashboard is available at `monitoring/grafana/dashboard.json`. Import this dashboard to visualize:

- API request rates and latency
- GPU utilization and memory usage
- Error rates and types
- Database connection status

### 3. Vercel Analytics Integration

The Vercel deployment includes built-in analytics for monitoring:

- Deployment status and performance
- Edge function execution times
- Frontend performance metrics
- Request volume and cache hit rates

## Alerting Setup

### Critical Alerts

Configure alerts for the following critical conditions:

1. **API Downtime**: When the API is unreachable for more than 2 minutes
2. **GPU Failure**: When GPU acceleration is unavailable or fails
3. **Database Connection Failure**: When SAP HANA Cloud connection fails
4. **High Error Rate**: When error rate exceeds 5% of requests
5. **Authentication Failures**: When multiple failed login attempts occur

### Warning Alerts

Configure warning alerts for the following conditions:

1. **High GPU Temperature**: When GPU temperature exceeds 80Â°C
2. **High GPU Memory Usage**: When GPU memory usage exceeds 90%
3. **Elevated Response Time**: When API response time exceeds 500ms
4. **Elevated Error Rate**: When error rate exceeds 2% of requests

## Logging Configuration

The system uses structured JSON logging with the following log levels:

- `ERROR`: For errors that require immediate attention
- `WARNING`: For conditions that may lead to errors
- `INFO`: For significant events (default level)
- `DEBUG`: For detailed debugging information

Log output includes request IDs for correlation across services.

## Monitoring Dashboard Access

Access the monitoring dashboards at:

- Prometheus: `https://prometheus.your-domain.com`
- Grafana: `https://grafana.your-domain.com`
- Vercel Analytics: Vercel dashboard for your project

## Incident Response

When alerts are triggered:

1. Check the health endpoints for detailed status information
2. Review logs for error messages and context
3. Verify GPU status and database connectivity
4. Check for recent deployments or configuration changes
5. Refer to the troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Regular Maintenance

Schedule regular maintenance tasks:

1. Review error logs weekly
2. Analyze performance metrics monthly
3. Test alert configurations quarterly
4. Update monitoring dashboards as needed
